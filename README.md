# Red Django
It's a small backend server application for managing remote cloud storage of user files. The idea was to easliy print files at Xerox shops
without the need to carry pendrives are logging in to your gmail/drive account in an unsecure computer. So you would just upload the files
you need to print through the Red Django mobile app, and scan the qr code generated at the website. Now you can easily transfer the files
from your phone to the computer at the Xerox shop easily. No need to carry pendrives or logging in an unsecure computer.
